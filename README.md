# AI-BASED-WORKPLACE-COMPLIANCE-SAFETY-OPTIMIZATION
# BUSINESS PROBLEM:
The manual monitoring and reporting of safety incidents and compliance issues is inefficient, prone to delays, and inconsistent due to human error. This process can lead to potential safety hazards, regulatory fines, and increased downtime. The current approach relies on employees to report incidents or track compliance manually, which is labor-intensive and creates bottlenecks in maintaining a safe work environment.

# OBJECTIVE:
Maximize Workplace Safety, Maximize Hard Detection..
 

# CONSTRAINT:
Minimize cost.
